#This is me

Hello, my name is Juan Sebastian Vargas. I'm a recently graduated of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering from Los Andes University, Colombia. My parents are my biggest proud and my family my biggest motivation. 

## Hobbies

I have always been passionate about cuisine. I love to spend my free time learning new recipes. However, I also enjoy going out and taste new things. Furthermore, I consider myself a coffee lover, one of the most important thing that I package on my bag when I travel to London was my Colombian coffee and my French Press.

##About Colombia

If you have never travel to Colombia, please do it. Colombia is wonderful country, full of colors, nature and marvelous people. If one day you want to go, please let me know and I will advice you of the best places to visit on my Country. Below, I put some pictures to give you a sense of how beutuful is my country. Hope you enjoy them.
