<p>Regarding the difficult situation that the whole world is living due to this pandemic, is important to make some statistical analysis about the morbidity rate of this desease. First of all, we downloaded the data from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf">CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data</a></p>
<pre class="r"><code># file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data

  clean_names()</code></pre>
<p>Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>#create dataset for Covid death % by age group, sex and presence of co-morbidities
covid_data_comorbidities &lt;- covid_data %&gt;% 
#clean the dataset to get rid of the missing values 
  filter(sex %in% c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;),
         !age_group %in% c(&quot;Unknown&quot;, NA), 
         medcond_yn %in% c(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;), 
         death_yn %in% c(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;)) %&gt;%
#group the variables of interest
  group_by(sex, age_group, medcond_yn) %&gt;% 
#calculate the death rate
  summarise(death = sum(death_yn == &quot;Yes&quot;), total = n()) %&gt;% 
  mutate(death_rate = (death / total * 100)) %&gt;% 
  select(sex, age_group, medcond_yn, death_rate)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(scales) #include this library in the loadlibraries section

#plot the covid_data_comorbitities dataset
ggplot(covid_data_comorbidities, aes(x = death_rate, y = age_group)) +
#create graph in blue with digit and using facet_grid
  geom_col(fill = &quot;blue&quot;) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = round(death_rate, digits = 1)), hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
  facet_grid(medcond_yn~sex, as.table = FALSE, labeller = labeller(medcond_yn = c(&quot;Yes&quot; = &quot;With Comorbities&quot;, &quot;No&quot; = &quot;Without Comorbities&quot;))) + 
#include title, source, theme and label
  labs(title = &quot;Covid death % by age group, sex and presence of co-morbidities&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: CDC&quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 11)) +
  NULL</code></pre>

<p>As you can evidence, there is a strong difference on the morbidity rate between the people who had a co-morbidity and people who didnâ€™t. And the difference increases considerably for people over 40 years old. Moreover, we can evidence that in average men are more susceptible to died by covid-19 in comparison with women, specially if they have a co-morbidity before.</p>
<p>Next, we proceed to create the second graph with the following variables:</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>#create dataset for Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU
covid_data_icu &lt;- covid_data %&gt;%
#clean the dataset to get rid of the missing values 
  filter(sex %in% c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;), 
         !age_group %in% c(&quot;Unknown&quot;, NA), 
         icu_yn %in% c(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;), 
         death_yn %in% c(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;)) %&gt;%
#group the variables of interest
  group_by(sex, age_group, icu_yn) %&gt;% 
#calculate the death rate
  summarise(death = sum(death_yn == &quot;Yes&quot;), total = n()) %&gt;% 
  mutate(death_rate = (death / total * 100)) %&gt;% 
  select(sex, age_group, icu_yn, death_rate)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>#plot the covid_data_icu dataset
ggplot(covid_data_icu, aes(x = death_rate, y = age_group)) +
#create graph in salmon with digit and using facet_grid
  geom_col(fill = &quot;salmon&quot;) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = round(death_rate, digits = 1)), hjust = -0.1, size = 3) +
  facet_grid(icu_yn~sex, as.table = FALSE, labeller = labeller(icu_yn = c(&quot;Yes&quot; = &quot;Admitted to ICU&quot;, &quot;No&quot; = &quot;No ICU&quot;))) + 
#include title, source, theme and label
  labs(title = &quot;Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: CDC&quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 11)) +
  NULL</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Finally, when looking at the last graph is very worrying to see how the death rate increases when someone is admitted to ICU. The rate for people over 80 years old is almost 80% regardless of their sex. Moreover, we arriave to the same conclution as the first graph, that men are more susceptible to died by covid-19 than women. Therefore, analyzing the data the governments should pay special attention to the patients which are accepted to ICU and try to reduce this proportion significantly to save more lives.</p>
