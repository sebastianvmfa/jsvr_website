<p>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a> and it has already been saved in the Data directory.</p>

<p>When downloading the data from wikipedia we obtained a messy data. First, express all figures in billions (divide values by 1e9, or 109) and later we use the <code>gather</code> function to convert the years columns into rows. Then, we <code>spread</code> this new dataframe to create columns with the indicator names for later changing them to have an easier manipulation. Finally, we <code>gather</code> again for having the indicator names and years as rows in the dataframe. Moreover, we create a list with our country of interest for doing a further analysis.</p>

<p>As shown in the graph above, the household expenditure is the biggest component of GDP over the years, while exports is the smaller component for the Colombian economy. Moreover, household expenditure increase sharply in the last 30 years. On the other hand, the remaining four variables has a similar value and raising tendency over the time for all the countries evaluated.</p>
<p>Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). In our data frame we have an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> that has this calculation, but for analysis purposes we will estimate this indicator and compare it with the value given.</p>

This graph shows the percentage of difference between the GDP calculated and the GDP given, you can observe that for Colombia the percentage of difference is negative for the first 20 years, i.e., the GDP calculated for Colombia is above the GDP given in the data. However, for the last 10 years, the difference is near to zero probably because the governments of each country made better quality estimations.</p>
