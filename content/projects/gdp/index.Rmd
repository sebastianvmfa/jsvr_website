At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. 


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("content/projects/gdp/data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

When downloading the data from wikipedia we obtained a messy data. First, express all figures in billions (divide values by 1e9, or 109) and later we use the `gather` function to convert the years columns into rows. Then, we `spread` this new dataframe to create columns with the indicator names for later changing them to have an easier manipulation. Finally, we `gather` again for having the indicator names and years as rows in the dataframe. Moreover, we  create a list with our country of interest for doing a further analysis.

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data #Create a variable for tidying the data
tidy_GDP_data[,4:51] <- tidy_GDP_data[,4:51]/1e9 #Express all figures in billions 

tidy_GDP_data <- gather(tidy_GDP_data, #Convert the years columns into rows 
                        key = "Year", 
                        value = "GDP", 
                        -CountryID, 
                        -Country, 
                        -IndicatorName)
tidy_GDP_data <- spread(tidy_GDP_data, #Convert indicator names into columns
                        IndicatorName, 
                        GDP)
tidy_GDP_data$Year <- as.numeric(tidy_GDP_data$Year) #Set the year as a numeric variable

tidy_GDP_data <- rename(tidy_GDP_data,  #rename the indicator names
                        c("ID" = "CountryID",
                          "Agriculture" = "Agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing (ISIC A-B)", 
                          "Inventories" = "Changes in inventories", 
                          "Construction" = "Construction (ISIC F)", 
                          "Exports" = "Exports of goods and services",
                          "Consuption expenditure" = "Final consumption expenditure",
                          "Government expenditure" = "General government final consumption expenditure",
                          "GDP" = "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)",
                          "Gross fixed capital formation" = "Gross fixed capital formation (including Acquisitions less disposals of valuables)",
                          "Household expenditure" = "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)",
                          "Imports" = "Imports of goods and services",
                          "Manufacturing" = "Manufacturing (ISIC D)",
                          "Utilities" = "Mining, Manufacturing, Utilities (ISIC C-E)",
                          "Other activities" = "Other Activities (ISIC J-P)",
                          "Transport" = "Transport, storage and communication (ISIC I)",
                          "Leisure" = "Wholesale, retail trade, restaurants and hotels (ISIC G-H)"))

tidy_GDP_data <- gather(tidy_GDP_data, #Convert indicator names columns into rows
                        key = "Indicator", 
                        value = "GDP", 
                        -ID, 
                        -Country, 
                        -Year)

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data) #Eximine the data

# List of 3 countries oof interest
country_list <- c("Colombia")
```

As shown above, the new data frame has 5 columns only, instead of 51 as the original data. Then, we graph the GDP components for our country of interest. The GDP is compound by exports, government expenditure, gross capital formation, household expenditure and imports. 

```{r}
indicator_list <- c("Gross capital formation", #List of indicators who compound the GDP
                    "Exports", 
                    "Government expenditure", 
                    "Household expenditure", 
                    "Imports")

my_list <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
    filter(Country %in% country_list, #Filter the data by countries in the country_list
           Indicator %in% indicator_list) #Filter the data by indicator in the indicator_list

#Plot the GDP components over time
ggplot(my_list, aes(x = Year, y = GDP, colour = Indicator))  +
    geom_line() + 
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1970, 2020), breaks = seq(1970, 2020, by = 10)) +
    labs(x = "", y = "Billion US$", 
         title = "GDP components over time", subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD") +
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(legend.position = "right", plot.title = element_text(size = 20)) + 
    NULL


```

As shown in the graph above, the household expenditure is the biggest component of GDP over the years, while exports is the smaller component for the Colombian economy. Moreover, household expenditure increase sharply in the last 30 years. On the other hand, the remaining four variables has a similar value and raising tendency over the time.

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). In our data frame we have an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` that has this calculation, but for analysis purposes we will estimate this indicator and compare it with the value given.

```{r}
my_list_2 <- spread(tidy_GDP_data, Indicator, GDP) %>% #Convert indicator names to columns
  mutate(GDP_calculate = `Household expenditure` + #Estimate the GDP by hand
           `Gross capital formation` + 
           `Government expenditure` +
           `Exports` -
           `Imports`,
         percentage_difference = (GDP - GDP_calculate)/GDP) %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) #Filter the data by the countries of interest

#Plot the results
ggplot(my_list_2, aes(x = Year, y = percentage_difference)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(size = 20)) +
    labs(x = "", y = "Percentage", 
         title = "% Difference between GDP calculated and GDP given") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    NULL
  
```
This graph shows the percentage of difference between the GDP calculated and the GDP given, you can observe that for Colombia the percentage of difference is negative for the first 20 years, i.e., the GDP calculated for Colombia is above the GDP given in the data. However, for the last 10 years, the difference is near to zero probably because the Colombian government is making better quality estimations.
