If you wanted to study climate change, you can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

After loading the data, we proceed to examine the data frame.

```{r tidyweather}
#tidy data
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  #select the year and months column (i.e. the first 13 columns)
  select(Year:Dec) %>% 
  #change format to long
  pivot_longer(cols = Jan:Dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "delta")

#inspect data
glimpse(tidyweather)
```

As shown in the tables above, there are three columns: year, month and delta of the temperature.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline to see if there is a tendency in the weather anomalies throughout the years.

```{r scatter_plot}
#create a new variable "date" to ensure our plot is in chronological order
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies" #add a more descriptive title
  )

```

As shown in the graph above, there is a clear upward tendency over the years. However, it will be better to analize the effect of increasing temperature by months.

```{r facet_wrap}
#ordering by month the dataset
tidyweather$month = factor(tidyweather$month, levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))

#scatter plot for each month
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x = date, y = delta)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color = "red")+
  facet_wrap(~month)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Weather Anomalies for All Months")+
  NULL


```


However, looking at the graph there is no clear differences between months. However, during february and march we evidence the highest incrase over the time. Therefore, we decided to group data into different time periods. 


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

By analyzing the graph we can see that the more the time interval comes closer to the present, the more to the right is the delta distribution. So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x= Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly", x = "Year", y = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```

As you can see in this final plot, there is a clear tendency on the data over the years. The weather anomalyes have been increasing since 1980, reaching an incresing temperature of 1 celsius degree. If we continue this tendency in less than 10 years we can reach a delta of 2 degrees, which will be really dangerous for the life in the earth. 

## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.


```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present", !is.na(delta)) %>% 
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta),
            sd_delta = sd(delta),
            count = n(),
            se_delta = sd_delta / sqrt(count),
            t_critical_0.95 = qt(0.95, count - 1),
            margin_error = t_critical_0.95 * se_delta,
            CI_lower = mean_delta - margin_error,
            CI_upper = mean_delta + margin_error
  )

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci %>% 
  select(mean_delta, sd_delta, count, se_delta, CI_lower, CI_upper) %>% 
  kable %>% 
  kable_styling()
```


Lastly, the confidence intervals showcase that, on average, the temperature is approximately +0.966 degrees than the temperature of the base period. Additionally, the data allows us to claim that under a 95% confidence interval the values of delta will range between (+0.923 and +1.01). Hence, we must worry about climate change and how we can reduce it significantly.
